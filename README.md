![Table displaying Wardley's Doctrine, universally useful patterns that a user can apply regardless of context. Format is the Steve Purkis variation: rows are phases of adoption, columns are categories of patterns. Description of the patterns by phase and category starts from the bottom left and finishes at the top right, suggestive of order of adoption. Phase 1. Communication: Common language; Challenge assumptions; Understand what is being considered. Development: Know your users; Focus on user needs; Remove bias and duplication; Use appropriate methods. Operation: Know the details; Learning: Bias towards data. Phase 2. Communication: A bias towards open. Development: Focus on the outcome; Think fast, inexpensive, restrained and elegant; Use appropriate tools; Be pragmatic; Use standards. Operation: Manage inertia; Manage failure; Effectiveness over efficiency. Learning: Bias towards action. Leading: Move fast; Strategy is iterative. Structure: Think small teams; Distribute power and decision making; Think aptitude and attitude. Phase 3. Operation: Optimise flow; Do better with less; Set exceptional standards. Learning: Bias towards the new. Leading: Commit to the direction; Be the owner; Inspire others; Embrace uncertainty; Be humble. Structure: Provide purpose, mastery and autonomy; Seek the best. Phase 4. Learning: Listen to your ecosystem. Leading: Exploit the landscape; There is no core. Structure: Design for constant evolution; No single culture.](doctrine-purkisvar.jpg)
